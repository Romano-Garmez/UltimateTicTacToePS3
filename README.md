# UltimateTicTacToe PS3

A version of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, made in Unity, but downgraded to Unity 5.4.0b3 for PS3 build support. This build of the game includes controller support for UI and gameplay, along with other small fixes.



## Compiling

To compile the game, you will need the Unity PS3 SDK. The best way to get this set up is to find a file online called "Unity PS3 + SDK Full installer v1.8.zip". I would link to it, but I don't believe I can legally redistribute it.



## Installing and playing on real hardware

To play the game on a real PS3, you may need to enable DEX mode, I'm still not clear on this. When in CEX mode, the game installs and launches, but hangs on a black screen after launching. In DEX mode, the game installs and launches properly. 



## Installing and playing on RPCS3

The game can be installed using RPCS3's install PKG function, but the emulator will crash when launching the game. Haven't figured out why just yet.
